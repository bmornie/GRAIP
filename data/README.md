These are the PPI networks used in the experimental section of our paper.  
For all networks, we kept only the largest connected component.

### [IntAct](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/intact/interactomes)

- *Haloferax volcanii* (taxid: 309800): The network consists of 695 interactions between 138 proteins, with average edge existance probability of 0.35.

- *Eschericha coli* (strain K12) (taxid: 83333): The network consists of 682 interactions between 341 proteins, with average edge existance probability of 0.48.

### [MINT](https://mint.bio.uniroma2.it/index.php/download/)
Networks for individual species were extracted from the 'all_MINT' data file, by filtering the interactions based on the taxid of the interactors.

- *Helicobacter pylori* (taxid: 85962): The network consists of 1465 interactions between 714 proteins, with average edge existance probability of 0.38.

- *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* (taxid: 559292): The network consists of 18428 interactions between 4442 proteins, with average edge existance probability of 0.46.

### [STRING](https://string-db.org/cgi/download)
We downloaded the physical subnetwork dataset and kept only interactions with combined score $\ge$ 700 (p $\ge$ 0.7).

- *Thermococcus nautili* (taxid: 195522): The network consists of 1275 interactions between 158 proteins, with average edge existance probability of 0.84.

- *Methanolobus tindarius* (taxid: 1090322): The network consists of 2498 interactions between 338 proteins, with average edge existance probability of 0.79.
