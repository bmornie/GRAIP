#### An example script to show how to use the code. In this script, we will:
####    1. Generate a small probabilistic BA graph as target network (you will skip this step in practice, as you will already have a target network).
####    2. Derive its properties through sampling.
####    3. Generate graphs with GRAIP and SwapCon.
####    4. Evaluate the generated graphs.
